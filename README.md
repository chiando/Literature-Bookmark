Literature-Bookmark
===================

Literature Bookmark is a management system for bookmarks. It's a plugin for the Chrome browser. 
The aim of the bookmarking tool is to enable a fast and simple analysis of formal features of scanned texts.
The tool copies the metadata of a scanned text into its GUI and allows the bookmarking of paratexts such as mottoes,
dedications, forewords, footnotes etc.

In its current form the plugin accepts the following sources:

- Gallica (Biblioth√®que nationale de France): gallica.bnf.fr
- Internet Archive: archive.org

With the plugin you can categorize and store bookmarks in the local database of Chrome. Multiple entries are possible
as well. The database can be exported in csv-Format for further use.
